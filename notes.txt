overall todo list
-investigate here api

    -see if we can do what we want it to do:
        -see how much point of interest data is available
        -see what information here does not have that other apis do have (that we care about)
        -figure out how to integrate them
-git repository
-actually code the api
    -code the part that interfaces with here api
    -code the part that interfaces with other apis
    -structure and organize it will enough to be actually used internaly
